# Auto-Approval Decision Framework for Sanctions Low-Risk Alerts

## Why this project exists
In sanctions screening operations, not all alerts are created equal.

A significant portion of sanctions alerts is generated by weak similarities and low-risk signals. These alerts rarely convert into true matches, yet they consume a large amount of operational capacity.

The purpose of this project is to document how low-risk sanctions alerts can be resolved earlier in the process by making better use of screening signals that were already available, but not effectively leveraged in decision-making.

## The real challenge
The challenge was to significantly reduce the volume of low-risk sanctions alerts requiring manual review without introducing regulatory risk.

This meant defining decision rules strict enough to safely auto-approve low-risk alerts, while ensuring that any case requiring human judgment could not bypass review.

The solution required conservative decision boundaries, explicit stop conditions, and systematic handling of edge cases.

## What I built
I designed the business rules and exception logic that determine when a sanctions alert can be auto-approved and when it must be escalated to human review.

The decision logic was implemented and applied in a large, highly regulated fintech operating in Latin America.

This included:
- Defining decision criteria aligned with regulatory requirements  
- Explicitly mapping non-automatable scenarios and edge cases  
- Partnering with engineering throughout development  
- Supporting testing, validation, and rollout of the decision logic

## Where this logic applies
The decision logic applies at two points in the customer lifecycle:
- Customer onboarding  
- Ongoing monitoring triggered by profile updates or changes in sanctions lists

## My role
I worked as a Regulatory Operations Specialist acting as the business owner of the decision logic within the AML-CFT domain.

In practice, I represented the AML-CFT perspective within the squad, owning:
- The definition of business rules and decision boundaries  
- Alignment with compliance stakeholders  
- Translation of regulatory intent for engineering  
- Validation of decision behavior

## Controls
- Any ambiguity routes the alert to human review  
- Critical sanctions categories are never auto-approved  
- Alerts with insufficient data are escalated  
- Decision paths are deterministic and auditable  

---

## Impact
- ~**95% of sanctions alerts** auto-approved under the decision logic  
- Human review focused on ~**5%** of alerts classified as high-risk or ambiguous  
- Equivalent to **~0.25 FTE** freed (based on 44 hours/week)

These results were achieved without introducing new data sources or relaxing regulatory controls.

## How this could evolve
Future iterations could incorporate a curated knowledge base of analyst-confirmed true matches to support periodic refinement of decision criteria, under governance oversight.
